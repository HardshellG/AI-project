<h1><center> History of AI</h1></center><br>
<p><h2><span class=a>Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1955.
The field of AI research was born at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956,[32] where the term "Artificial Intelligence" was coined by John McCarthy to distinguish the field from cybernetics and escape the influence of the cyberneticist Norbert Wiener."machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do". Marvin Minsky agreed.
In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems,[42] a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. 
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, AI began to be used for logistics, data mining, medical diagnosis and other areas.The success was due to increasing computational power (see Moore's law and transistor count)Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion.
According to Bloomberg's Jack Clark, 2015 was a landmark year for artificial intelligence, with the number of software projects that use AI Google increased from a "sporadic usage" in 2012 to more than 2,700 projects.Rise in cloud computing infrastructure and to an increase in research tools and datasets,other cited examples include Microsoft's development of a Skype system that can automatically translate from one language to another and Facebook's system that can describe images to b<image src="1p.png" height="400" weight="400" align="right"  id="a"><br>
